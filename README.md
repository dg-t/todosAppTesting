# TO-DO LIST APP: Enhance an existing project

### Working on an existing codebase:
- Step 1: Fix bugs:
  - TYPO bug: typo was 'adddItem' function name. Now to-do items can be added.
  - ID bug: the `<label>` "for" attribute did not match the `<input>` "id" to target it.
  - Code improvements:
    - Loops optimization
    - Removed unnecessary logging statements
- Step 2: Add tests using jasmine framework:
  - Run npm install  on the project to install the requisite Jasmine materials.
  - In the ControllerSpec.js file add tests.
- Step 3: Analyze performance.
- Step 4: Write technical documentation.
